# Log-Analyzer-with-Federated-Learning
Developed a federated log analysis system using LogFormer with LoRA, applying decentralized training on real-world datasets (HDFS, BGL, OpenStack) to ensure data privacy. Simulated multi-client environments for distributed anomaly detection, achieving high accuracy via secure aggregation and efficient communication.
